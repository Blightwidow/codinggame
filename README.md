# Codinggame code

This is just a bunch of code that I came up for coding game. In order to be able to store them and reuse them later, I
am putting them here.

Most of them are incomplete or not working yet. I also use the READMEs as a todo-list.

I mostly use Typescript. While not very optimized for performance and bots, it is fun to use and easy to read, which
is useful to me when I am often on & off the platform for months at a time.
