# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

## Wood

For wood, a simple minMax algorithm of infinite depth will break all oponnents

## Bronze

In bronze, the game get more complex and a minMax everyturn is not possible. My current thinking is to build a solution
tree during the longer first turn. By cutting early branches with losses or win, I might be able to build it in less
than a second

### TODO

- [ ] Implement the Simulation tree generation
